This semester I am doing an minor field on religion in 19th century America. I am super excited to be focusing on my content area of choice! In addition to the general greatness of religion in the 19th century, the readings I am doing with the amazing [Sharon Leon][1] are focused on religious women. While we will be addressing the major themes of the period, the goal is to intentionally shift the focus to the religious worlds experienced, promoted, and constructed by women.

Our &#8220;syllabus&#8221; is available at [www.6floors.org/teaching/womens-religious-history-19th-century-america-fall-2012/][2]

I will be posting responses to the books on the reading list. If for whatever reason you are interested in following along, my short reactions will be found at [jeriwieringa.com/blog/category/relminorfield][3].
