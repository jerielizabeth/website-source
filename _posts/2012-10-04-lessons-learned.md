Today I learned the difference between &#8220;update&#8221; and &#8220;insert&#8221; and what happens when you update your join table instead of inserting a new entry.

I almost have CRUD &#8211; keep finding new things to add/tweak. Also my files are growing increasingly complex to keep track of all of the different ways data is being passed.

Questions:

*   difference between &#8220;object orientated&#8221; and &#8220;procedural&#8221; in the mysqli manual
*   when to use &#8220;if&#8221; for calling a command and when it isn&#8217;t necessary &#8211; is this just to test that it&#8217;s working (so you can have an &#8216;else&#8217;)?
*   Can we talk about refactoring?
