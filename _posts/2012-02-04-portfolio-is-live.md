So the first iteration of my portfolio is live.

Well, not the first.

More like the 10th.

But the first that I&#8217;m willing to go live with.

Some outstanding issues that I am still working on:

*   getting the sidebar to fill in to equal length with the content section.
*   the footer needs to be narrower &#8211; but there is something funky with the &#8220;badges&#8221; that is adding padding or margins.
*   manipulating the CSS for the links! This one I am completely stuck on. I&#8217;ve tried a couple of things, but they either don&#8217;t work, or don&#8217;t work like I expect. Also, I would love to have links in the sidebar, but I can&#8217;t seem to create separate styling, so both the nav bar and the sidebar links are either black or my background grey. Which means one of them is unintelligible.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, please let me know! Also if anyone has IE, could you tell me how it looks? <img src='http://jeriwieringa.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />

*update: apparently I should have watched the typography tutorials earlier &#8211; I think the key to different styles for links may be there.
