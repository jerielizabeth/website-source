So I&#8217;ve been working on text-mining all week and that has generally gone very well.

I am a little less confident on the libraries used to create visualizations from text-mining results using python. The main one I have seen referenced is [matplotlab][1], which is slightly intimidating and feels more science/math focused.

Are there python libraries that humanities types use for visualizations? Are other languages/programs preferred? How do you create the graphical representation of your humanities data?

(I may be jumping ahead a bit here, but I have this list of word frequencies and it feels sad to leave it as a list.)
