*Quaker Women: Personal Life, Memory and Radicalism in the Lives of Women Friends, 1780 &#8211; 1930* is a study of the Priestman and Bright extended families, made possible by the study of the correspondence and religious journals of the women of these interconnected families. The family network of those studied stretched from England to the United States and the record of the family shows how the relationship between religious practice, social norms, and political goals changed over time.

The text focuses primarily on the English portion of the family. It covers the shifting pressures caused by marriage, children, death, and financial concerns and highlights the ways in which religion shaped those responses and was shaped by them.
