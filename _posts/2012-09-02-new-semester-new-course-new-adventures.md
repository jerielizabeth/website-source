As part of [History 698][1], currently named &#8220;Programming for Historians,&#8221; we are creating tutorials for [programminghistorian.org][2]. I will be posting my tutorials here, along with reflections on the process of applying data manipulation to historical investigation.

Expect tutorials on web scrapping and on text mining in the coming months.

To follow my coding efforts, go to [jeriwieringa.com/dev][3].
