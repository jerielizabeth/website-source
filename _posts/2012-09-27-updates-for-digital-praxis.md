Thanks to Sasha&#8217;s kind help, my attempts to display my database values have progress a few baby-steps further.

The &#8220;show&#8221; page is showing the data from both the person and the text table. Next step is adding the &#8220;add author&#8221; form under the display of author data and to add a link to &#8220;edit&#8221; either author or text (or maybe both in one form &#8230; thoughts&#8230;).

So it&#8217;s in its most recent form at [clio3.jeriwieringa.com/view.php][1]
