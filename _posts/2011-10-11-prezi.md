Hi all,

Here is a [sneak-peak][1] of my Prezi presentation for tonight!

Also, the [video][2] at the end of the [article for today][3] was really helpful! If you have 20 minutes, it is worth a watch. In it, Seth Godin speaks of the importance of &#8220;thrashing&#8221; ideas during the beginning stages of a project, so that one can proceed with confidence through the creation and implementation of those projects. In line with that insight, please &#8220;thrash&#8221; my project tonight!
