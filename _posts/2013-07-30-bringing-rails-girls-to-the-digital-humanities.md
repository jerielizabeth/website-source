Last fall I attended [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) DC, a one day workshop that introduces women to programming using Ruby on Rails. It was a wonderful event and I learned a lot. But I also left inspired to bring this sort of event to the Digital Humanities! We too have a gender gap and need to support women interested in the coding side the field.

And so, on September 6 & 7 we are hosting a [Digital Humanities focused Rails Girls Workshop](http://railsgirls.com/digitalhumanities_fairfax) with the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. We will be focusing on questions of code in humanities research while learning to create a simple Ruby on Rails application. And we have an amazing team of coaches who will help guide participants through the code.

The event is open to women scholars of all ranks and career paths interested in learning to use Ruby on Rails in their work.  [Please join us!](http://railsgirls.com/digitalhumanities_fairfax)
